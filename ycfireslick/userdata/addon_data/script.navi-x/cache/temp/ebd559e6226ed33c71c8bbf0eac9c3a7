description=The Back to the Future franchise is a comedic science fiction adventure film series written by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, directed by Zemeckis, produced by Amblin Entertainment, and distributed by Universal Pictures.
The first film was the highest-grossing film of 1985 and became an international phenomenon, leading to the second and third films which were back to back film productions, released in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Though the two sequels did not perform quite as well at the box office as the first film, the trilogy remains immensely popular after a quarter of a century and has yielded such spin-offs as an animated television series and a motion-simulation ride at the Universal Studios Theme Parks in Universal City, California; Orlando, Florida (now closed), and Osaka, Japan, as well as a Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, iPad, PS3 and Wii video game. The film's visual effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic. All together, the trilogy was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one (Best Sound Editing)./description

This collection is mostly complete.

The Survivor Series is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view event held in November by WWE. It is one of the "Big Four" events, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble and SummerSlam, as it is one of the original four pay-per-views produced by WWE.
Survivor Series is the 2nd longest running pay-per-view event in WWE history, behind WrestleMania. The first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the incredible success of WrestleMania III, as the then-WWF began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view market. During a press conference held on February 11, 2010, WWE announced that it would drop the Survivor Series name and rebrand the event. However, in June 2010, the event was added back onto WWE's pay-per-view schedule.

Watch out, as I will be uploading more WWE/WWF back catalogues over time :)

description=The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding World War II. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations, but in most countries it started in about 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s or early 1940s. It was the longest, most widespread, and deepest depression of the 20th century.
 
In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline. The depression originated in the U.S., starting with the fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929 and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). From there, it quickly spread to almost every country in the world.
 
The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and in some countries rose as high as 33%./description

description=The Scooby-Doo Show is the blanket name for the episodes from the third incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo. A total of 40 episodes ran for three seasons, from 1976 to 1978, on ABC, marking the first Scooby series to appear on the network. Sixteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour in 1976, eight episodes were produced as segments of Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics in 1977 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1978, with nine of them running by themselves under the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! name and the final seven as segments of Scooby's All-Stars.

Despite the yearly changes in the way they were broadcast, the 1976Ã¢??1978 stretch of Scooby episodes represents, at three seasons, the longest-running format of the original show before the addition of Scrappy-Doo. The episodes from all three seasons have been rerun under the title The Scooby-Doo Show since 1980; these Scooby episodes did not originally air under this title. The credits on these syndicated versions all feature a 1976 copyright date, even though some were originally produced in 1977 and 1978. Reruns are currently airing on CBBC. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.

description=Stargate SG-1 (often abbreviated as SG-1) is an adventure and military science fiction television series and part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Stargate franchise. The show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 science fiction film Stargate by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, Canada. The series premiered on Showtime on July 27, 1997; the final episode first aired on Sky1 on March 13, 2007. With 214 episodes over 10 seasons, Stargate SG-1 had surpassed The X-Files as the longest-running North American science fiction television series, a record it holds to this day, regarding the time span it was running. However, regarding the number of episodes, it has since been surpassed by the series Smallville with its 218 episodes.

The story of Stargate SG-1 begins about a year after the events of the feature film, when the United States government learns that an ancient alien device called the Stargate can access a network of such devices on a multitude of planets. SG-1 is an elite United States Air Force special operations team, one of about 20 teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats such as the Goa'uld, the Replicators, and the Ori. The series draws primarily upon Egyptian mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, and Arthurian legend.

The series was a ratings success for its first-run broadcasters and in syndication, and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. Stargate SG-1 was honored with numerous awards and award nominations in its ten-season run. It also spawned the animated television series Stargate Infinity, the live-action spin-off TV series Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe, and the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum. Merchandise for Stargate SG-1 includes games and toys, print media, and an original audio series.

description=Put your hands up with the Pawn Stars as the guys check out a wanted poster for legendary criminal John Dillinger. Will they capture it for the shop, or let this one get away? Then, a Lambretta scooter zooms into the shop. Can this vintage Italian ride withstand a test ride by Chumlee? And later, the guys bet on who can take the most steps in a week, but will one of them rig the count?
