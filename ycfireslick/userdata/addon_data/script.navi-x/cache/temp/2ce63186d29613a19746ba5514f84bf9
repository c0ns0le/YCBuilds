description=Overview

The Vampire Diaries is a supernatural drama television series developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec, based on the book series of the same name written by L. J. Smith. The series premiered on The CW on September 10, 2009. The series takes place in Mystic Falls, Virginia, a fictional small town haunted by supernatural beings. The series narrative follows the protagonist Elena Gilbert as she falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore and is drawn into the supernatural world as a result. As the series progresses, Elena finds herself drawn to Stefan's brother Damon Salvatore resulting in a love triangle. As the narrative develops in the course of the series, the focal point shifts on the mysterious past of the town involving Elena's malevolent doppelgÃ¤nger Katerina Petrova and the family of Original Vampires, all of which have an evil agenda of their own.



The pilot episode attracted the largest audience of any series premiere since the network began in 2006. The first season averaged 3.60 million viewers and following seasons have maintained an audience of over 2 million viewers. Despite such ratings being considered low on other networks, it remains the most-watched series on the network. The series initially received mixed reviews, but critics agreed as the first season progressed that the show improved. Subsequent seasons have premiered to more positive critical reception. The show has received numerous award nominations, winning two People's Choice Award and many Teen Choice Awards.

His trademark hit songs include "Indian Outlaw", "Don't Take the Girl", "I Like It, I Love It", "Something Like That", "It's Your Love" (featuring his wife, Faith Hill), and "Live Like You Were Dying".

McGraw had eleven consecutive albums debut at Number One on the Billboard albums charts. Twenty-one singles hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country 100 chart. Three singles became the No. 1 country song of the year ("It's Your Love", "Just To See You Smile", and "Live Like You Were Dying").[citation needed] He has won 3 Grammys, 14 Academy of Country Music awards, 11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards, and 3 People's Choice Awards.

description=SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of "Bikini Bottom". The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise, contributing to its position as Nickelodeon's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks, and among Nicktoons' most-watched shows.[1] As of 2011, SpongeBob SquarePants is the only Nicktoon from the 1990s that hasn't ended yet.

The basis for SpongeBob SquarePants was formed by Hillenburg in 1984 while teaching and studying marine biology at the Ocean Institute in Dana Point, California, where he wrote the comic strip The Intertidal Zone, which starred various anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters. He left the institute to become an animator in 1987, and later attended the California Institute of Arts in 1992. In the institute, he made his thesis film Wormholes (1992), which led to his hiring as a director, writer, producer, storyboard artist, and executive producer of the series Rocko's Modern Life by creator Joe Murray. He started to develop the series in 1996 following Rocko's Modern Life's, and pitched the series to Nickelodeon in 1998 and was later greenlit for a first season.

The pilot episode of SpongeBob SquarePants first aired episodes in the United States on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999, following the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. The first episodes were called "Help Wanted", "Reef Blower", "Tea at the Treedome". The "official" series premiere followed on July 17, 1999, with the second episode, "Bubblestand/Ripped Pants." The show reached enormous popularity by 2000 and has remained popular since. A feature film of the series was released in theaters on November 19, 2004. The series is currently in its seventh season and celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 17, 2009. SpongeBob was renewed for a ninth season on January 3, 2011,[2] and the traditional definition of season is different for this series and defines more that episodes are ordered for future airing rather than they will be aired throughout one calendar year./description

description=Prison Break is an American television serial drama created by Paul Scheuring, that was broadcast on Fox for four seasons, from 2005 to 2009. The series revolves around two brothers. One brother has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and the other devises an elaborate plan to help his brother escape prison and clear his name. The series was produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions, in association with Original Television and 20th Century Fox Television. Along with creator Paul Scheuring, the series is executive produced by Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who directed the pilot episode. The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006.[1]

The series was originally turned down by Fox in 2003, which was concerned about the long-term prospects of such a series. Following the popularity of serialized prime time television series Lost and 24, Fox decided to back production in 2004. The first season received generally positive reviews,[2] and performed well in the ratings. The first season was originally planned for a 13-episode run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. Prison Break was nominated for several industry awards, and won the 2006 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama and was nominated for the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Drama. In the United States, all four seasons have been released on DVD and released on Blu-ray internationally.

The success of the series has inspired short videos for mobile phones, several official tie-ins in print and on the Internet, as well as a video game. A spin-off series, Prison Break: Proof of Innocence, was produced exclusively for mobile phones. The series has spawned an official magazine and a tie-in novel. The fourth season of Prison Break returned from its mid-season break in a new timeslot on April 17, 2009 for the series' last six episodes.[3] Two additional episodes, titled "The Old Ball and Chain" and "Free" were produced, and were later transformed into a standalone feature, titled The Final Break. The events of this feature take place before the last scene of the series finale, and are intended to conclude unfinished plotlines. The feature was released on DVD and Blu-ray July 21, 2009.[4] In June 2015, it was announced that a limited series revival was in development at Fox.[5] In August 2015, it was announced that a 10-episode limited series was ordered to debut on Fox in 2016

description=The most famed and honored filmmaker ever to emerge from the nation of Sweden  and regarded by many as one of the three or four most brilliant directors of the 20th century Ingmar Bergman radically altered the nature and meaning of the motion-picture form, transfiguring a medium long devoted to spectacle into an art capable of profoundly personal meditations into the myriad struggles facing the psyche and the soul. By focusing on the exploration of self with unparalleled intensity, Bergman brought to the screen a new sense of emotional intimacy, fusing the concepts behind Freudian psychotherapy with a dreamlike sensibility founded on visual metaphors, flashbacks, and extreme close-ups to create a revelatory cinematic world unlike any before it.







Born Ernst Ingmar Bergman on July 14, 1918, in Uppsala, Sweden, he followed a brief 1938 military stay by attending Stockholm University. While there, he staged his first plays, among them adaptations of Macbeth, August StrindbergÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s Lucky PeterÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s Journey and Master Olaf, and Maurice MaeterlinckÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s The Blue Bird. In 1939, Bergman accepted the job of production assistant at the Royal Theatre (the Stockholm Opera), leaving school the following year to focus on stage work. By early 1943, he had begun work at the script department of Svensk Filmindustri, with his original screenplay for Hets (Torment) filmed by leading director Alf SjÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¶berg the following year.







While remaining active in the theater, Bergman also continued his work in the film industry, and in the summer of 1945 he began directing his debut feature, Kris (Crisis), an adaptation of a drama by Leck Fischer. His next four films Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â? 1946Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s Det Regnar pÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¥ VÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¥r KÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¤rlek (It Rains on Our Love), 1947Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s Skepp till Indialand (A Ship Bound for India), and 1948Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢s Musik i MÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¶rker (Night Is My Future), and Hamnstad (Port of Call) Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¬Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â? were all adaptations as well, although Bergman continued crafting original screenplays, including one for the 1947 Gustaf Molander feature Kvinna Utan Ansikte (Woman Without a Face).

In addition to directing his own original script, the feature also marked the introduction of a number of Bergman hallmarks including his patented emotional complexity, a fascination with the dynamics of marriage, and a willingness to experiment with the motion-picture form and structure.

In 1950, Bergman began shooting Sommarlek (Summer Interlude), his breakthrough effort.

His first period piece, the film was his bleakest work to date, drawing from the breadth of his major influences (particularly 1930s French films and silent German cinema) to create a newly mature and distinctive visual sensibility.

The film which brought him international renown, it marked a turning point away from the romantic explorations of his earlier work toward an examination of the relationships of man to God and death, a theme which remained at the center of his work for many years to come. A medieval morality play, The Seventh Seal contains one of the most memorable scenes in all of cinema, in which the knight portrayed by Max von Sydow opposes Death in a game of chess. The winner of the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, The Seventh Seal launched Bergman to the forefront of the global filmmaking community, a position he would not relinquish throughout the duration of his career.

He also maintained his busy theatrical schedule and in 1987 published an autobiography, Laterna Magica (The Magic Lantern). In 1992, his script Den Goda Viljan (The Best Intentions) was filmed for television by Bille August; three years later, he announced his withdrawal from the stage, but by 1996 he was shooting the television drama Larmar och GÃ?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â?Ã?Â¶r Sig Till (In the Presence of a Clown).

description=The most famed and honored filmmaker ever to emerge from the nation of Sweden Ã¢ÂÂ and regarded by many as one of the three or four most brilliant directors of the 20th century Ã¢ÂÂ Ingmar Bergman radically altered the nature and meaning of the motion-picture form, transfiguring a medium long devoted to spectacle into an art capable of profoundly personal meditations into the myriad struggles facing the psyche and the soul. By focusing on the exploration of self with unparalleled intensity, Bergman brought to the screen a new sense of emotional intimacy, fusing the concepts behind Freudian psychotherapy with a dreamlike sensibility founded on visual metaphors, flashbacks, and extreme close-ups to create a revelatory cinematic world unlike any before it.

Born Ernst Ingmar Bergman on July 14, 1918, in Uppsala, Sweden, he followed a brief 1938 military stay by attending Stockholm University. While there, he staged his first plays, among them adaptations of Macbeth, August StrindbergÃ¢ÂÂs Lucky PeterÃ¢ÂÂs Journey and Master Olaf, and Maurice MaeterlinckÃ¢ÂÂs The Blue Bird. In 1939, Bergman accepted the job of production assistant at the Royal Theatre (the Stockholm Opera), leaving school the following year to focus on stage work. By early 1943, he had begun work at the script department of Svensk Filmindustri, with his original screenplay for Hets (Torment) filmed by leading director Alf SjÃÂ¶berg the following year.

While remaining active in the theater, Bergman also continued his work in the film industry, and in the summer of 1945 he began directing his debut feature, Kris (Crisis), an adaptation of a drama by Leck Fischer. His next four films Ã¢ÂÂ 1946Ã¢ÂÂs Det Regnar pÃÂ¥ VÃÂ¥r KÃÂ¤rlek (It Rains on Our Love), 1947Ã¢ÂÂs Skepp till Indialand (A Ship Bound for India), and 1948Ã¢ÂÂs Musik i MÃÂ¶rker (Night Is My Future), and Hamnstad (Port of Call) Ã¢ÂÂ were all adaptations as well, although Bergman continued crafting original screenplays, including one for the 1947 Gustaf Molander feature Kvinna Utan Ansikte (Woman Without a Face).

In a sense, BergmanÃ¢ÂÂs career began in earnest with 1949Ã¢ÂÂs FÃÂ¤ngelse (The DevilÃ¢ÂÂs Wanton), his first true auteur work. In addition to directing his own original script, the feature also marked the introduction of a number of Bergman hallmarks including his patented emotional complexity, a fascination with the dynamics of marriage, and a willingness to experiment with the motion-picture form and structure. TÃÂ¶rst (Three Strange Loves), based on a screenplay by Herbert Grevenius, followed in 1949, but within months Bergman was filming Till GlÃÂ¤dje (To Joy), another original effort again exploring a disintegrating marriage.

In 1950, Bergman began shooting Sommarlek (Summer Interlude), his breakthrough effort. Told extensively through flashback, the film hones in on a number of the themes which would continue to recur throughout his oeuvre, including the loss of artistic identity, the demise of love, and the slow decay of life, all explored with a newfound confidence and grace. The political thriller SÃÂ¥nt HÃÂ¤nder Inte HÃÂ¤r (This CanÃ¢ÂÂt Happen Here) soon followed, but in 1951 the Swedish film studios suffered a shutdown, reducing Bergman to helming soap commercials. Upon returning to work in 1952, he filmed the relatively lightweight Kvinnors VÃÂ¤ntan (Secrets of Women) before turning to 1953Ã¢ÂÂs Sommaren med Monika (Summer with Monika), another exploration of an ill-fated romance.

With 1953Ã¢ÂÂs Gycklarnas Afton (Sawdust and Tinsel/The Naked Night), Bergman made his next significant leap. His first period piece, the film was his bleakest work to date, drawing from the breadth of his major influences (particularly 1930s French films and silent German cinema) to create a newly mature and distinctive visual sensibility. The sense of freedom so dominant throughout Gycklarnas Afton remained for 1954Ã¢ÂÂs farcical En Lektion i KÃÂ¤rlek (A Lesson in Love). After 1955Ã¢ÂÂs KvinnodrÃÂ¶m, Bergman created his next masterpiece, the intricate romantic comedy Sommarnattens Leende (Smiles of a Summer Night).

Having hit his stride, Bergman began work on one of his most famed efforts, 1957Ã¢ÂÂs Det Sjunde Inseglet (The Seventh Seal). The film which brought him international renown, it marked a turning point away from the romantic explorations of his earlier work toward an examination of the relationships of man to God and death, a theme which remained at the center of his work for many years to come. A medieval morality play, The Seventh Seal contains one of the most memorable scenes in all of cinema, in which the knight portrayed by Max von Sydow opposes Death in a game of chess. The winner of the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, The Seventh Seal launched Bergman to the forefront of the global filmmaking community, a position he would not relinquish throughout the duration of his career.

BergmanÃ¢ÂÂs obsession with death continued in 1957Ã¢ÂÂs brilliant SmultronstÃÂ¤llet (Wild Strawberries), starring Victor SjÃÂ¶strÃÂ¶m as an aging professor reminiscing about the disappointments which tainted his life. After the somewhat slight NÃÂ¤ra Livet (Brink of Life), Bergman helmed 1958Ã¢ÂÂs gothic comedy Ansiktet (The Magician), a stunning return to form. The medieval setting of The Seventh Seal reappeared in 1960Ã¢ÂÂs JungfrukÃÂ¤llan (The Virgin Spring), a controversial essay on rape which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was followed later that same year by DjÃÂ¤vulens ÃÂga (The DevilÃ¢ÂÂs Eye).

The outstanding SÃÂ¥som i en Spegel (Through a Glass Darkly) was the next step in BergmanÃ¢ÂÂs evolution, marking the beginning of his Ã¢ÂÂchamberÃ¢ÂÂ style of photography Ã¢ÂÂ essentially, a penchant for extreme close-ups designed to highlight the nuances of his actorsÃ¢ÂÂ faces to underscore a sceneÃ¢ÂÂs psychological intensity. It also opened his so-called Ã¢ÂÂreligious trilogy,Ã¢ÂÂ a series of films exploring crises of faith, which also included 1962Ã¢ÂÂs NattvardsgÃÂ¤sterna (Winter Light) and 1963Ã¢ÂÂs Tystnaden (The Silence). In the wake of 1964Ã¢ÂÂs FÃÂ¶r Att Inte Tala om Alla Dessa Kvinnor (All These Women), Bergman planned to mount a theatrical production of The Magic Flute, but instead fell prey to a viral infection which kept him out of action during the early months of 1965.

When he returned to the screen in late 1966 with Persona, it was with a renewed sense of force and purpose. An intense meditation on identity which is later revealed to be an examination of the very nature of cinema itself, the film was his most avant-garde effort to date and remains his crowning masterpiece. Another trilogy of films, all of them set on the tiny island of FÃÂ¥rÃÂ¶ Ã¢ÂÂ 1968Ã¢ÂÂs Vargtimmen (Hour of the Wolf) and Skammen (Shame), rounded out by BergmanÃ¢ÂÂs first color film, 1969Ã¢ÂÂs En Passion (The Passion of Anna) Ã¢ÂÂ concluded the decade. In 1970, Bergman directed his first English-language film, The Touch. The masterful Viskningar och Rop (Cries and Whispers) followed in 1972, with the acclaimed television miniseries Scenes from a Marriage premiering in 1973. The small screen remained BergmanÃ¢ÂÂs medium of choice for the next several years, with The Magic Flute in 1975 and Ansikte mot Ansikte (Face to Face) in 1976. That same year, he was arrested for alleged tax evasion, later leaving Sweden as a voluntary exile. Relocating to Munich, he began work on 1977Ã¢ÂÂs The SerpentÃ¢ÂÂs Egg, his first feature film in half a decade.

After completing 1978Ã¢ÂÂs Autumn Sonata, Bergman entered the 1980s with Aus dem Leben der Marionetten (From the Life of the Marionettes). Two years later, he released the Oscar-winning Fanny och Alexander (Fanny & Alexander), a final, autobiographical masterpiece announced as his cinematic swan song. He then turned strictly to television, premiering Efter Repetitionen (After the Rehearsal) in 1984, followed a year later by The Blessed Ones. He also maintained his busy theatrical schedule and in 1987 published an autobiography, Laterna Magica (The Magic Lantern). In 1992, his script Den Goda Viljan (The Best Intentions) was filmed for television by Bille August; three years later, he announced his withdrawal from the stage, but by 1996 he was shooting the television drama Larmar och GÃÂ¶r Sig Till (In the Presence of a Clown).

After years of inactivity following that project, Bergman Ã¢ÂÂ in late 2002 Ã¢ÂÂ broke his vow of cinematic retirement on one final occasion. He would later recall feeling a kind of Ã¢ÂÂpregnant sicknessÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as if pregnant with an idea. That idea materialized as a two-hour made-for-television sequel to the directorÃ¢ÂÂs 1973 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage. Shot in the fall of 2002 and released in 2003 to universal acclaim, Saraband followed Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and JohanÃ¢ÂÂs (Erland Josephson) reunion after a lengthy estrangement, and examined the extent to which parents can psychologically scar their children and one another./description

description=Set in a futuristic dystopia where society is divided into five factions



that each represent a different virtue, teenagers have to decide if they want to



stay in their faction or switch to another - for the rest of their lives. Tris Prior



makes a choice that surprises everyone. Then Tris and her fellow faction-members



have to live through a highly competitive initiation process to live out the choice



they have made. They must undergo extreme physical and intense psychological tests,



that transform them all. But Tris has a secret that she is Divergent, which means



she doesn't fit into any one group. If anyone knew, it would mean a certain death.



As she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect



society, this secret might help her save the people she loves... or it might destroy



her./description
